I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Bio and Brain Engineering](https://bioeng.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). My research projects draws upon ideas in data science, applied statistics, and machine learning to interpret large collections of biomedical data. In collaboration with experimentalists, I also enjoy solving computational problems and designing algorithms to tackle fundamental questions in modern biology.

Previously, I had the opportunity to work very closely with molecular biologists in [V. Narry Kim's lab](http://www.narrykim.org/) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html). In 2016, I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) working with [Olga G. Troyanskaya](https://function.princeton.edu/). Before that, I received my B.S. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://www.ma.utexas.edu/) at [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) where I was first introduced to computational biology by [Tandy Warnow](https://tandy.cs.illinois.edu/).

*If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to [contact me](#contact) with a brief overview of your background and research interests.*
