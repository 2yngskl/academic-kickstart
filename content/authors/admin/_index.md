I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Bio and Brain Engineering](https://bioeng.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). Previously, I had the opportunity to work very closely with molecular biologists in [V. Narry Kim's lab](http://www.narrykim.org/) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html). I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) working with [Olga G. Troyanskaya](https://function.princeton.edu/). Before that, I received my B.S. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://www.ma.utexas.edu/) at [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) where I was first introduced to computational biology from [Tandy Warnow](https://tandy.cs.illinois.edu/).

My research interests lies in developing accurate and scalable strategies for the interpretation of biomedical data in the context of emerging mechanistic insights from molecular biology. Like many data scientists, I too believe that data is the medium to better understanding this complicated world. For me, that world is molecular biology because that is where I believe the most impactful insights and implications are hidden in this post-genomic era. Rigorous analyses of these collections of unorganized biological data are now shading light into the future of personalized medicine such as RNA therapeutics. Yet, the lack of simple robust methods to interpret this large collection of data hinders our ability to fully extract fundamental insights in human genomics.
