> The science of today is the technology of tomorrow.  
-- Barbara McClintock

Biology is not random, just largely unknown. There are almost an *infinite* amount of possible interactions, yet only a sparse handful constitutes a complex living system. To narrow down this vast search space, massive amounts of biological data are being generated to capture snapshots or snippets of the functional genome, multicellular heterogeneity, and complex human diseases. In this effort, bioinformatics algorithms play a key role in interpreting these large data collections and elucidating the underlying principles, both at the molecular and system levels.

The Young Laboratory at KAIST draws upon ideas from data science, applied statistics, and machine learning to tackle fundamental questions in quantitative biology. We incorporate *problem-specific* knowledge into the behavior of our algorithms to address the challenge of underspecification in modern machine learning methods. One of our primary objectives is to complete the human gene regulatory network. Specifically, we aim to map the missing regulatory axes of functional RNAs in terms of RNA modification, RNA structure, and protein-RNA interaction.
