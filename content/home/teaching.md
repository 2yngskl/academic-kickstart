The advent of massive open online courses (MOOCs) has changed the way we look at education and further questioned the fundamental role of instructors. Simple transfer of knowledge is no longer the rate limiting step for educating the next generation, but knowledge is democratized to anyone with a computer, tablet or mobile phone with a connection to the internet. I personally have benefited tremendously from such efforts, yet MOOCs have forced me to reassess my pedagogical ideals. This led me to the three foundations of instruction and mentorship: construction, selection, and interaction. All of which are the basis of the following courses shared below.

- Spring 2023: BiS437 Bio-Data Engineering
- Fall 2022: BiS232 Bio-Data Structures
- Spring 2022: BiS800 Methods in Functional Genomics and Computational Molecular Biology
