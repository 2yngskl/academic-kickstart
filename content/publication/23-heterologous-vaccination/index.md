abstract: "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus was first discovered in 2009 as the causative agent of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Despite its potential threat to public health, no prophylactic vaccine is yet available. This study developed a heterologous prime-boost strategy comprising priming with recombinant replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) expressing the surface glycoprotein, Gn, and boosting with Gn protein. This vaccination regimen induced balanced Th1/Th2 immune responses and resulted in potent humoral and T cell-mediated responses in mice. It elicited high neutralizing antibody titers in both mice and non-human primates. Transcriptome analysis revealed that rAd5 and Gn proteins induced adaptive and innate immune pathways, respectively. This study provides immunological and mechanistic insight into this heterologous regimen and paves the way for future strategies against emerging infectious diseases."
